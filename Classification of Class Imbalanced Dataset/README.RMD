 
Project Topic: Classification of Class-imbalanced Dataset using Oversampling and Undersampling techniques

Tool: WEKA

Author: Archana Balachandran

 
Introduction:

The project aims to build an efficient classification model with high accuracy from a class imbalanced dataset. The initial dataset has 16 attributes and 3165 tuples, of which 2802 are ‘no’ tuples and 363 are ‘yes’ tuples. This represents a class imbalance problem, where the total number of a class of is far less than the total number of another class of data. Real life scenarios of class imbalance problem include fraud detection, anomaly detection, medical diagnosis, oil spillage detection, facial recognition, etc.

The task is to build a model that predicts ‘yes’ tuples with high accuracy, which is to ensure the highest TP rate, while being cautious of increasing FP rates.

Most machine learning algorithms and works best when the number of instances of each classes are roughly equal.
Two approaches identified to deal with class imbalance dataset by adjusting the class distribution of a dataset are cost function based approach and sampling approach. This project explores two of the popular sampling approaches –Oversampling and undersampling.
